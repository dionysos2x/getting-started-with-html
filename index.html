<h2>The Basics of the Web</h2>

<p>
The <em>world wide web (www)</em> is basically a huge collection of HTML documents,<br> located on many different computers 
which communicate via HTTP (<b>H</b>yper<b>T</b>ext <b>T</b>ransfer <b>P</b>rotocol),<br> the main protocol of the web.<br>
The many HTML files are connected via hyperlinks (URLs).<br> Web browsers can interpret the HTML files and display them for the user in a more appealing way. <br>
The web was invented in the 1990s and today consists of about 30 Billion pages.
</p>

<h2>HTML</h2>
<p>
HTML stands for <b>H</b>yper<b>T</b>ext <b>M</b>arkup <b>L</b>anguage. <br>
It is made up of:<br>
- text content (what you see)<br> 
- markup (describes how the text should look like)<br>
- references to other documents (e.g. images, videos and music)<br>
- links to other pages
</p>
<h3>Elements and Tags</h3>
<p>HTML code is made of elements which are defined by tags.<br>
There are many different HTML tags e.g. markup tags to make text <b>bold</b> or <em>italic</em>,<br>
the anchor tag to create links like <a href="http://www.udacity.com">www.udacity.com</a><br>
or the image tag to include images like this cute fellow <img src="http://www.udacity.com/cs253x/hipmunk.png" alt="hipmunk!"><br>
<p>
Other tags are for creating whitespace like linebreaks<br> or paragraphs.
</p>
Most HTML elements are defined by an opening tag and a closing tag,<br>
but some elements don't need a closing tag. Those are called <b>void tags</b>.</p>

<h4>Attributes</h4>
<p>HTML Attributes are found inside tags and give the tag more variety and options.<br>
The anchor tag's "href"-attribute for example is needed to define the URL for a link to another webpage.
</p>

<h4>Inline and Block Elements</h4>
<p>
HTML elements can be categorized as "inline" or "block", where block elements form an "invisible box"<br>
around their content e.g. the paragraph tag. 
</p>
<h3>The HTML Document Structure</h3>
<p>
In general the structure of an HTML document is as follows:<br>
- Definition of the doctype (doctypes bring different presettings for the HTML document)<br>
- Head (title and implementation of CSS and JavaScript can be defined here)<br>
- Body (the main content of the webpage)
